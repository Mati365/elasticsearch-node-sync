Tired of writing elasticsearch reindexing scripts? Are you constantly encountering data synchronization problems between the database and elasticsearch? Are you crying about the lack of namespaces in the organization of indexes in your cluster? Nothing lost! Here is **searchpunch** and punch this shit out!

## What does it offer? ‚≠ê

1.  0-downtime reindexing
2.  automatic removing unused indices based on IaC namespace definition ‚ôª
3.  synchronization of data between any database using async generators 
4.  automatic detection of index settings / mappings modification and reindex modified inndices
5.  bulk reindex of records
6.  group indices into namespaces 
8.  fully typed error handling using Either error handling

## Installation üöÄ

```bash
yarn add @searchpunch/reindex
```

## How index synchronization works? üõ†Ô∏è  

1. Load current mapping schema into memory
2. Check if specified index exists in ElasticSearch
   1. If not:
      1. Create new index
      2. Perform reindex of all records in storage
   2. If exists compare mappings with ElasticSearch index stored in `meta` fields as hash
      1. If equal skip reindex
      2. If differs perform full reindex

## Where it can be used? üèóÔ∏è

1. Building ecommerce shops with aggregated products
2. Searching logs in dashboard
3. Autocomplete select inputs
4. ... and in many many other places
