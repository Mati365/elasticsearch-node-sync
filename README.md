0-downtime Elasticsearch (and OpenSearch) reindex functional utility. Automatically detect ES mapping modification and reindex modified records.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install @searchpunch/elastic-reindex-stream
```

## How index synchronization works?

1. Load current mapping schema into memory
2. Check if specified index exists in ElasticSearch
   1. If not:
      1. Create new index
      2. Perform reindex of all records in storage
   2. If exists compare mappings with ElasticSearch index stored in `meta` fields as hash
      1. If equal skip reindex
      2. If differs perform full reindex

## Where it can be used?

1. Building ecommerce shops with aggregated products
2. Searching logs in dashboard
3. Autocomplete select inputs
4. ... and in many many other places

## Is it official Elasticsearch product?

No
